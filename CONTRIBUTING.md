   ```

## Development Workflow

Our development workflow follows these steps:

1. **Pick an issue** - Select an open issue to work on or create a new one
2. **Discuss** - For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change
3. **Branch** - Create a feature branch for your work
4. **Code** - Make your changes, following our coding standards
5. **Test** - Add tests for your changes and ensure all tests pass
6. **Document** - Update documentation as needed
7. **PR** - Submit a pull request

## Coding Standards

We follow these principles in our codebase:

- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** - Avoid code duplication
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)** - Prefer simple solutions over complex ones
- **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)** - Don't implement features until they're needed
- **SOLID** - Follow SOLID principles for object-oriented design
- **File Size** - Keep file sizes reasonable (<300 lines) for better maintainability

### Python Style Guide

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for Python code style
- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Use Google-style docstrings
- Implement proper error handling with try/except blocks

### Documentation

- Keep README.md and other documentation up-to-date
- Document all public functions and classes
- Include examples in docstrings
- Add inline comments for complex logic

## Pull Request Process

2. Update documentation as needed
3. Add or update tests as appropriate
4. Ensure all tests are passing
5. Fill out the pull request template completely
6. Request review from maintainers
7. Address any feedback from code reviews

PRs will be merged once they:
- Pass all automated checks
