## Overview

OpenAI Agents Travel Graph is an advanced AI-powered travel planning system that leverages the latest in multi-agent technology to automate the entire travel planning process. The system orchestrates specialized agents to handle different aspects of travel planning, from destination research and flight bookings to accommodation selection and activity planning.

By combining the power of the OpenAI Agents SDK with graph-based orchestration through LangGraph, the system can maintain complex workflows while providing personalized travel recommendations that meet user preferences and budget constraints.

## System Architecture

The system follows a comprehensive multi-layered architecture with specialized agents coordinated through LangGraph:

```mermaid

    %% Main system layers
    UI[User Interface Layer] --> OL
    
    %% Orchestration layer
    subgraph OL[Orchestration Layer - LangGraph]
        SM[State Management]
        AWM[Agent Workflow Management]
        CP[Context Preservation]
    end
    
    %% Specialized agents
    OL --> DRA[Destination Research Agent]
    OL --> FSA[Flight Search Agent]
    OL --> ASA[Accommodation Search Agent] 
    OL --> TPA[Transportation Planning Agent]
    OL --> APA[Activity Planning Agent]
    
    %% Browser automation & budget management
    DRA & FSA & ASA & TPA & APA --> BAL[Browser Automation Layer]
    BAL --> BMA[Budget Management Agent]
    BMA --> KML[Knowledge & Memory Layer]
    KML --> PS[Persistent Storage - Supabase]
    
    %% Styling

    class UI,OL,BAL,KML,PS systemLayer
    class DRA,FSA,ASA,TPA,APA,BMA agent
```

Each specialized agent uses a combination of LLM capabilities and domain-specific tools to perform its tasks, with the orchestration layer maintaining state and ensuring proper handoffs between agents.

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/BjornMelin/openai-agents-travel-graph.git
cd openai-agents-travel-graph

# Set up a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\\Scripts\\activate

# Install uv package manager
curl -sSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | bash

# Install dependencies
uv pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys and configuration

# Set up Supabase database
python supabase_setup.py init
```

### Supabase Setup

This project uses Supabase for data persistence. You need to set up a Supabase project and configure it with the database schema. The `supabase_setup.py` script automates this process:

```bash
# Initialize the database with required tables and indexes
python supabase_setup.py init

# Check the status of your Supabase database
python supabase_setup.py status

# Reset the database (WARNING: This will delete all data)
python supabase_setup.py reset

# Create test data for development
python supabase_setup.py init --test-data
```

For more information about the database schema, see [Migrations README](travel_planner/data/migrations/README.md).

## Usage

Run the travel planner in interactive mode:

```bash
python -m travel_planner.main
```

Or provide a query directly:

```bash
python -m travel_planner.main --query "I want to visit Tokyo for a week in October" --origin "New York" --budget "3000-5000"
```

For more options:

```bash
python -m travel_planner.main --help
```
